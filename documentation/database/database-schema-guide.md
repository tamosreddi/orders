# üìö Database Schema Guide - AI-Powered Order Management Platform

**A complete guide for engineers to understand our database architecture**

## üéØ **Overview**

This platform is a **multi-tenant B2B order management system** with AI-powered message processing. The database supports:

- **Multi-channel communication** (WhatsApp, SMS, Email)
- **AI agents** for natural language order processing
- **Multi-tenant architecture** with distributor isolation
- **Enterprise security** with RLS and encryption
- **Real-time messaging** and webhook integrations

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Core Architecture**

### **Multi-Tenant Foundation**
Every table is isolated by `distributor_id` - each business (distributor) sees only their own data.

### **Authentication Integration**
Uses Supabase Auth with custom user profiles for role-based permissions.

### **AI-First Design**
Every message, order, and product interaction is enhanced with AI processing and learning.

## üè¢ **Multi-Tenancy & Authentication**

### **distributors**
**Purpose**: The main tenant table - each row represents a business using the platform. This is the core table that enables multi-tenancy by isolating all data by business.

**Key Fields** (Complete Column List):
- `id`: Unique identifier for the distributor
- `business_name`: The company's legal or operating name
- `domain`: Custom domain for the distributor (optional)
- `subdomain`: Unique subdomain like "acme.orderagent.com"
- `api_key_hash`: Encrypted API key for external integrations
- `webhook_secret`: Secret for webhook authentication
- `subscription_tier`: FREE, BASIC, PREMIUM, ENTERPRISE - determines feature access
- `subscription_status`: ACTIVE, SUSPENDED, CANCELLED - billing status
- `billing_email`: Email for invoices and billing notifications
- `contact_name`: Primary contact person's name
- `contact_email`: Primary business email for support
- `contact_phone`: Business phone number
- `address`: Physical business address
- `timezone`: Business timezone (default: UTC)
- `locale`: Language preference (default: en)
- `currency`: Business currency (default: USD)
- `ai_enabled`: Whether AI features are active
- `ai_model_preference`: Preferred AI model (default: gpt-4)
- `ai_confidence_threshold`: Minimum confidence (0.0-1.0) for auto-processing orders
- `monthly_ai_budget_usd`: Maximum monthly AI spending limit
- `status`: ACTIVE, INACTIVE, PENDING_SETUP - account status
- `onboarding_completed`: Whether initial setup is finished
- `max_customers`: Customer limit based on subscription
- `max_monthly_messages`: Message limit per month
- `max_monthly_ai_requests`: AI request limit per month
- `created_at`, `updated_at`: Standard timestamps

**Relationships**:
- ‚û°Ô∏è **customers**: One distributor can have many customers (filtered by distributor_id)
- ‚û°Ô∏è **user_profiles**: One distributor can have many team members
- ‚û°Ô∏è **orders**: One distributor processes many orders
- ‚û°Ô∏è **products**: One distributor manages their own product catalog
- ‚û°Ô∏è **conversations**: All conversations belong to one distributor
- ‚û°Ô∏è **ai_usage_metrics**: Tracks AI usage per distributor

**How It Works**: Every major table in the system includes a `distributor_id` column that references this table. This creates complete data isolation - when User A from Company X logs in, they only see data where `distributor_id` matches Company X's ID. This is enforced through Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

**Why It Exists**: Enables Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) multi-tenancy where thousands of businesses can use the same platform while their data remains completely separate and secure.

---

### **user_profiles**
**Purpose**: Links Supabase Auth users to distributors with role-based permissions. This table extends Supabase's authentication with business-specific user data and roles.

**Key Fields** (Complete Column List):
- `id`: Primary key that also references `auth.users(id)` from Supabase Auth
- `distributor_id`: Which business this user belongs to
- `first_name`: User's first name
- `last_name`: User's last name  
- `display_name`: Preferred display name in the UI
- `avatar_url`: Profile picture URL
- `role`: OWNER, ADMIN, MANAGER, OPERATOR - determines base permissions
- `permissions`: Custom permissions beyond role defaults (JSON array)
- `status`: ACTIVE, INACTIVE, SUSPENDED, PENDING - account status
- `email_verified`: Whether user's email is confirmed
- `last_sign_in_at`: Last successful login timestamp
- `last_activity_at`: Last time user performed any action
- `sign_in_count`: Total number of logins

- ‚û°Ô∏è **user_sessions**: User can have multiple active login sessions
- ‚û°Ô∏è **user_invitations**: Users can invite other team members
- ‚û°Ô∏è **ai_responses**: AI responses can be linked to specific users for feedback

**How It Works**: When a user signs up through Supabase Auth, a corresponding record is created here that links them to a specific distributor and assigns them a role. The role determines what data they can access and what actions they can perform within their distributor's data.

**Why It Exists**: Supabase Auth handles authentication (login/logout/passwords) but doesn't know about our business concepts like distributors and roles. This table bridges that gap by connecting authenticated users to business contexts.

---

### **user_invitations**
**Purpose**: Manages team member invitations with role assignment. Enables secure onboarding of new team members to a distributor's account.

**Key Fields** (Complete Column List):
- `id`: Unique invitation identifier
- `distributor_id`: Which business the invitation is for
- `email`: Email address of the person being invited
- `role`: ADMIN, MANAGER, OPERATOR - role to assign when accepted
- `permissions`: Additional permissions beyond the base role (JSON array)
- `invited_by`: User ID of who sent the invitation
- `invitation_token`: Unique secure token for the invitation link
- `status`: PENDING, ACCEPTED, EXPIRED, REVOKED - invitation state
- `expires_at`: When invitation expires (typically 7 days)
- `sent_count`: How many times invitation email was sent
- `last_sent_at`: When invitation was last emailed
- `accepted_at`: When invitation was accepted (if applicable)
- `revoked_at`: When invitation was cancelled (if applicable)
- `revoked_by`: User who cancelled the invitation
- `personal_message`: Custom message from inviter to invitee
- `created_at`: When invitation was created

**Relationships**:

- ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **user_profiles** (revoked_by): Who cancelled the invitation
- ‚û°Ô∏è **user_profiles**: When accepted, creates a new user profile

**How It Works**: When a user with appropriate permissions invites someone, this table stores the invitation with a secure token. An email is sent with a link containing the token. When clicked, the system verifies the token hasn't expired and creates a new user account with the specified role and distributor access.

**Why It Exists**: Enables secure, controlled team growth where business owners can invite employees, contractors, or partners with specific access levels without sharing passwords or manually creating accounts.

- ‚û°Ô∏è **customer_label_assignments**: Customer can have multiple category labels
- ‚û°Ô∏è **messages**: Customer receives and sends messages

**How It Works**: When a distributor adds a new business customer, a record is created here. The system automatically updates `total_orders`, `total_spent`, and `last_ordered_date` whenever new orders are placed. The `status` field is automatically updated based on ordering patterns - customers become "AT_RISK" if they haven't ordered recently, or "STOPPED_ORDERING" if they've been inactive for too long.

**Why It Exists**: Provides a complete profile of each business customer including contact information, ordering history, and behavioral status to help distributors manage relationships and identify at-risk accounts.

---

### **customer_labels**
**Purpose**: Categorization system for customers (Dairy, Restaurant, Bar, etc.). Allows distributors to organize customers into business categories.

- `description`: Optional detailed description of the label
- `is_predefined`: TRUE for system-provided labels, FALSE for custom ones
- `created_at`, `updated_at`: Standard timestamps

**Relationships**:
- ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **distributors**: Each label belongs to one distributor (or system-wide if predefined)
- ‚û°Ô∏è **customer_label_assignments**: Many customers can have this label

**How It Works**: Distributors can create custom labels to categorize their customers by business type, size, or other criteria. The system comes with predefined labels like "Restaurant", "Dairy", "Convenience Store" that all distributors can use.

**Why It Exists**: Enables flexible customer segmentation for targeted marketing, reporting, and filtering - helping distributors understand their customer base composition and tailor their approach.

---

### **customer_label_assignments**
**Purpose**: Many-to-many relationship between customers and labels. Enables customers to have multiple category labels.

**Key Fields** (Complete Column List):
- `customer_id`: Which customer this assignment belongs to
- `label_id`: Which label is being assigned
- `value`: Optional additional value for the label (e.g., "Large" for a "Restaurant" label)
- `assigned_at`: When this label was assigned to the customer

**Relationships**:
- ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **customers**: Which specific customer has this label
- ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **customer_labels**: Which specific label is assigned

**How It Works**: When a customer needs multiple categories, separate records are created here. For example, a business might be both "Restaurant" and "Dairy" if they serve food and sell milk products. The `value` field allows for additional context like "Large Restaurant" or "Specialty Dairy".

**Why It Exists**: Real businesses often fit multiple categories, so this junction table allows flexible, multi-dimensional customer categorization rather than forcing each customer into a single category.

---

- ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **distributors**: Each conversation belongs to exactly one distributor
- ‚û°Ô∏è **messages**: Conversation contains many individual messages
- ‚û°Ô∏è **orders**: Orders can be linked to the conversation where they originated

**How It Works**: When a customer sends their first message via any channel (WhatsApp, SMS, email), a conversation record is created. All subsequent messages between that customer and distributor on that channel are grouped under this conversation. Each customer can have separate conversations per channel (one WhatsApp conversation, one SMS conversation, etc.).

**Why It Exists**: Provides a unified inbox experience where distributors can manage all customer communications across multiple channels in one place, with proper threading and context preservation.

## üí° **Key Design Principles**

### **1. Multi-Tenancy First**
Every table has `distributor_id` for complete data isolation between businesses.

### **2. AI Enhancement**
Every user interaction is captured and enhanced with AI metadata for continuous learning.

### **3. Audit Everything**
All data access and modifications are logged for compliance and debugging.

### **4. Real-time Capable**
Architecture supports real-time updates through triggers and webhooks.

### **5. Extensible Integration**
External systems can be added without changing core schema.

---

## üöÄ **Getting Started for Engineers**

### **Understanding Data Isolation**
1. **Always filter by `distributor_id`** in queries
2. **Use RLS policies** - they automatically enforce tenant isolation
3. **Never hard-code distributor IDs** - use `get_current_distributor_id()`

### **Working with AI Data**
1. **Messages are processed asynchronously** by AI agents
2. **Check `ai_processed` flag** before assuming AI data exists
3. **Always include confidence scores** for AI-generated content

### **Adding New Features**
1. **Add `distributor_id` column** to new tables
2. **Create RLS policies** for tenant isolation
3. **Add AI enhancement fields** if applicable
4. **Update audit triggers** for new sensitive data

---

## üìà **Performance Considerations**

### **Indexes**
- All foreign keys are indexed
- `distributor_id` is included in composite indexes
- GIN indexes for JSONB and full-text search

### **Query Patterns**
- Queries are optimized for tenant-specific access
- AI processing happens in background jobs
- Real-time features use efficient partial indexes

### **Scaling**
- Schema supports horizontal sharding by distributor
- AI workloads can be processed separately
- Webhook deliveries are queue-based

---

## üéØ **Common Use Cases**

### **For Frontend Developers**
```sql
-- Get customer conversations with unread counts
SELECT c.*, conv.unread_count 
FROM customers c
JOIN conversations conv ON conv.customer_id = c.id
WHERE c.distributor_id = get_current_distributor_id()
ORDER BY conv.last_message_at DESC;
```

### **For AI Engineers**
```sql
-- Get messages needing AI processing
SELECT * FROM messages 
WHERE ai_processed = FALSE 
AND distributor_id = get_current_distributor_id()
ORDER BY created_at ASC;
```

### **For Analytics**
```sql
-- Monthly AI usage and costs
SELECT date_trunc('month', date) as month,
       SUM(cost_cents)/100.0 as cost_usd,
       SUM(requests_count) as requests
FROM ai_usage_metrics 
WHERE distributor_id = get_current_distributor_id()
GROUP BY month ORDER BY month;
```

### **For Order Sessions**
```sql
-- Get active order sessions with item counts
SELECT s.*, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT i.id) as total_items,
       COALESCE(SUM(i.quantity * i.unit_price), 0) as total_value
FROM conversation_order_sessions s
LEFT JOIN order_session_items i ON i.order_session_id = s.id
WHERE s.status IN ('ACTIVE', 'COLLECTING', 'REVIEWING')
  AND s.distributor_id = get_current_distributor_id()
GROUP BY s.id;
```

This database schema provides a robust foundation for an AI-powered, multi-tenant order management platform with enterprise-grade security and real-time capabilities. üöÄ

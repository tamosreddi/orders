# üìö Database Schema Guide - AI-Powered Order Management Platform

**A complete guide for engineers to understand our database architecture**

## üéØ **Overview**

This platform is a **multi-tenant B2B order management system** with AI-powered message processing. The database supports:

- **Multi-channel communication** (WhatsApp, SMS, Email)
- **AI agents** for natural language order processing
- **Multi-tenant architecture** with distributor isolation
- **Enterprise security** with RLS and encryption
- **Real-time messaging** and webhook integrations

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Core Architecture**

### **Multi-Tenant Foundation**
Every table is isolated by `distributor_id` - each business (distributor) sees only their own data.

### **Authentication Integration**
Uses Supabase Auth with custom user profiles for role-based permissions.

### **AI-First Design**
Every message, order, and product interaction is enhanced with AI processing and learning.

---

## üí° **Key Design Principles**

### **1. Multi-Tenancy First**
Every table has `distributor_id` for complete data isolation between businesses.

### **2. AI Enhancement**
Every user interaction is captured and enhanced with AI metadata for continuous learning.

### **3. Audit Everything**
All data access and modifications are logged for compliance and debugging.

### **4. Real-time Capable**
Architecture supports real-time updates through triggers and webhooks.

### **5. Extensible Integration**
External systems can be added without changing core schema.

---

## üöÄ **Getting Started for Engineers**

### **Understanding Data Isolation**
1. **Always filter by `distributor_id`** in queries
2. **Use RLS policies** - they automatically enforce tenant isolation
3. **Never hard-code distributor IDs** - use `get_current_distributor_id()`

### **Working with AI Data**
1. **Messages are processed asynchronously** by AI agents
2. **Check `ai_processed` flag** before assuming AI data exists
3. **Always include confidence scores** for AI-generated content

### **Adding New Features**
1. **Add `distributor_id` column** to new tables
2. **Create RLS policies** for tenant isolation
3. **Add AI enhancement fields** if applicable
4. **Update audit triggers** for new sensitive data

---

## üìà **Performance Considerations**

### **Indexes**
- All foreign keys are indexed
- `distributor_id` is included in composite indexes
- GIN indexes for JSONB and full-text search

### **Query Patterns**
- Queries are optimized for tenant-specific access
- AI processing happens in background jobs
- Real-time features use efficient partial indexes

### **Scaling**
- Schema supports horizontal sharding by distributor
- AI workloads can be processed separately
- Webhook deliveries are queue-based

---

## üéØ **Common Use Cases**

### **For Frontend Developers**
```sql
-- Get customer conversations with unread counts
SELECT c.*, conv.unread_count 
FROM customers c
JOIN conversations conv ON conv.customer_id = c.id
WHERE c.distributor_id = get_current_distributor_id()
ORDER BY conv.last_message_at DESC;
```

### **For AI Engineers**
```sql
-- Get messages needing AI processing
SELECT * FROM messages 
WHERE ai_processed = FALSE 
AND distributor_id = get_current_distributor_id()
ORDER BY created_at ASC;
```

### **For Analytics**
```sql
-- Monthly AI usage and costs
SELECT date_trunc('month', date) as month,
       SUM(cost_cents)/100.0 as cost_usd,
       SUM(requests_count) as requests
FROM ai_usage_metrics 
WHERE distributor_id = get_current_distributor_id()
GROUP BY month ORDER BY month;
```

This database schema provides a robust foundation for an AI-powered, multi-tenant order management platform with enterprise-grade security and real-time capabilities. üöÄ
